# Predicting-New-Employee-Salary
In an era where employee turnover due to salary dissatisfaction is increasingly prevalent, the need for accurate and fair salary prediction models has become paramount for organizations. This project report presents a comprehensive study on predicting new employee salaries based on current employee attributes using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. The primary objective of this research is to develop a model that not only aligns with organizational goals but also aids in attracting and retaining top talent while ensuring financial sustainability. 
The study employs a Multiple Linear Regression framework, analyzing variables such as years of experience and geographical distance from the workplace, while considering the age of employees. The methodology involves a rigorous statistical analysis to validate the model's assumptions, including linearity, independence, normality, and homoscedasticity, ensuring the reliability of the predictions. 
The results indicate that years of experience and distance are significant predictors of salary, while age does not show a significant impact. The final model demonstrates a high predictive accuracy with a predicted R-square of 95.66%, indicating its effectiveness in salary forecasting. The model's adequacy is confirmed through various statistical tests, ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios. 
This study contributes to the field of human resource management by providing a robust and interpretable framework for salary prediction. It enables organizations to make informed, datadriven compensation decisions, thereby addressing the challenges of employee retention and financial management. The findings of this research offer a solid foundation for future studies and practical applications in the realm of compensation management
